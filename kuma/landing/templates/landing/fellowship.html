            <h2>Want to be a part of something <strong>big</strong>?</h2>
            <p><strong>Launching in Q1 2015, the Mozilla Developer Fellowship intends to accelerate the involvement of highly-skilled and experienced web developers with the open web.</strong></p>
            <ul class="details">
                <li><span>Who?</span> Web and mobile developers with an established track record of contributions and expertise in a specific web technology, function or domain.</li>
                <li><span>What?</span> Seven weeks of partnering closely with Mozilla to (1) build curriculum, code or both; and (2) receive coaching, training and best practices for effectively communicating and educating with technical information. We expect this to be between 5-10 hours of your time per week.</li>
                <li><span>When?</span> Q2 2015 (exact dates to be announced). Mozilla will reimburse your travel costs up to $5K.</li>
                <li><span>Where?</span> Orientation at Mozilla (locations TBD) + Program at your normal workspace</li>
                <li><span>Why?</span>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Increase the reach and impact of your expertise</li>
                        <li>Move beyond coding and managing to educating</li>
                        <li>Build something used by hundreds of thousands (or more) developers worldwide</li>
                        <li>Directly impact and grow the value of the open web</li>
                    </ul>

            <h2>The Fine Print</h2>
            <p><strong>Mozilla will</strong> provide coaching, direction and training on teaching best practices, as well as reimburse Fellows for the Orientation trip (travel, lodging, meals and related expenses) up to $5K per Fellow.</p>
            <p><strong>The Fellows will</strong> meet the stated deliverables of their projects and meet weekly with their mentor, the program lead and their other Fellows. The Fellow will also share the results of their projects at 1-2 events agreed upon by the Fellow and the Program Director, as well as on their personal channels (blog, social media, etc). The Fellow is responsible for any related visas (Mozilla can provide any necessary supporting documentation).</p>
